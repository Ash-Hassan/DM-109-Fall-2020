## Description ##
This repository contains The Warshall Algorithm That is imlemented on html and Js, It is live on
http://dmproject.byethost7.com/

Warshall's algorithm is an efficient method of finding the adjacency matrix of the transitive closure of relation R on a finite set S from the adjacency matrix of R

## Approach ##
First we need to convert the input from textarea and type of string to a matirx, Then i Converted that Matrix to an Int Matrix.

After that the algorithm is implemented and output is shown by js .innerhtml.

## Issues Faced ##
In Javascript we cannot directly declare 2d array :(  
**Solution:**
The Solution was to make a single temparray and assign to another single array which makes it a 2d array.
