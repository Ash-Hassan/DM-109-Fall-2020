## Description ##
This repository contains The Warshall Algorithm That is imlemented on html and Js, It is live on
http://dmfinal.byethost3.com/

Warshall's algorithm is an efficient method of finding the adjacency matrix of the transitive closure of relation R on a finite set S from the adjacency matrix of R

## Approach ##
After implementing the phase 1 and making the algo run multiple times the only thing needed to do was to deploy the graph.
graph was fairly easy to implement as there was two list and just needed to append the values whereas the rest of the work was done by the plotly library.

## Issues Faced ##
Not familliar with js.
