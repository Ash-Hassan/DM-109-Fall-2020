## Description ##
This repository contains The Warshall Algorithm That is imlemented on html and Js, It is live on
http://dmproject.byethost7.com/

Warshall's algorithm is an efficient method of finding the adjacency matrix of the transitive closure of relation R on a finite set S from the adjacency matrix of R

## Approach ##
First we need to take the input from textarea and run the algo to the desired input, Then we use performance.now() to 
calcculate the time taken by the algo at the lowest matrix possibale then we work our way upto the desired input.
After that the output is shown by js .innerhtml.
